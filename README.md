# Cephtrace
```cephtrace``` is a project that delivers various ```eBPF``` based ceph tracing tools. These tools can be used to trace different ceph components dynamically, without the need to restart or reconfigure any of the ceph related services. Currently ```radostrace```, ```osdtrace```, and ```kfstrace``` have been implemented.

These tools can provide a great insight on the per-io based performance, and help to quickly identify any potential performance bottlenecks.

> üí° **New to CephTrace?** Ubuntu users can try it immediately with our [Quick Start](#-quick-start-ubuntu-only) (no installation needed), or [build from source](#Ô∏è-build-from-source) for other systems.

## üöÄ Quick Start 

**Try CephTrace in 30 seconds - no installation, no debug symbols, no compilation!**

For Ubuntu users, we provide pre-built binaries and DWARF data files for immediate use:

### radostrace
**radostrace** traces librados-based Ceph clients in real-time, showing detailed per-IO performance metrics. Run it on machines holding Ceph clients like:
- vms with ceph rbd volumes attached
- openstack Cinder and Glance services
- RGW gateway servers
- Any application using librados/librbd

### Step 1: Download Pre-built Binary
```bash
# Download the latest radostrace binary
wget https://github.com/taodd/cephtrace/releases/latest/download/radostrace
chmod +x radostrace
```

### Step 2: Download DWARF Data for Your Ceph Version
```bash
# Check your Ceph version
dpkg -l | grep librados

# Download corresponding DWARF file (example for Ceph 17.2.6-0ubuntu0.22.04.2)
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taodd/cephtrace/main/files/radostrace/17.2.6-0ubuntu0.22.04.2_dwarf.json
```

### Step 3: Start Tracing Immediately
```bash
# Trace all librados clients using pre-built data
sudo ./radostrace -i 17.2.6-0ubuntu0.22.04.2_dwarf.json
```

### osdtrace
**osdtrace** traces OSD operations directly on Ceph storage nodes, providing detailed latency breakdowns from messenger to bluestore level. Run it on:
- Ceph OSD nodes

```bash
# Download osdtrace binary
wget https://github.com/taodd/cephtrace/releases/latest/download/osdtrace
chmod +x osdtrace

# Check your ceph-osd version
dpkg -l | grep ceph-osd

# Download corresponding DWARF file for osdtrace (example for Ceph 17.2.6)
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taodd/cephtrace/main/files/osdtrace/17.2.6-0ubuntu0.22.04.2_dwarf.json

# Start tracing OSD operations
sudo ./osdtrace -i 17.2.6-0ubuntu0.22.04.2_dwarf.json -x
```

### kfstrace
**kfstrace** traces Ceph kernel client requests using kprobes, showing data operations (OSD) and/or metadata operations (MDS) with detailed latency information. Run it on machines using CephFS or kernel-based RBD clients:
- CephFS clients (kernel mounts)
- Kernel RBD clients
- Any system using the Ceph kernel client module

```bash
# Download kfstrace binary
wget https://github.com/taodd/cephtrace/releases/latest/download/kfstrace
chmod +x kfstrace

# Trace MDS requests only (default mode)
sudo ./kfstrace

# Trace OSD requests only
sudo ./kfstrace -m osd

# Trace both OSD and MDS requests
sudo ./kfstrace -m all

# Trace for 30 seconds with both modes
sudo ./kfstrace -t 30 -m all
```

> üìã **Available DWARF Files:** Check the `files/ubuntu/radostrace/` and `files/ubuntu/osdtrace/` directories for your specific Ceph version
> üêß **Ubuntu Support:** Currently available for Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04, and 24.04
> ‚ö° **Zero Dependencies:** No need to install debug symbols or build dependencies (kfstrace doesn't require DWARF files)

### Tracing Processes in cephadm deployed CentOS Stream Containers

When tracing Ceph processes running inside CentOS Stream containers, you need to specify the process ID and skip version checking since the binary runs on the host while the traced process runs in the container.

#### radostrace for CentOS Stream Containers

```bash
# Download radostrace binary
wget https://github.com/taodd/cephtrace/releases/latest/download/radostrace
chmod +x radostrace

# Download DWARF file for CentOS Stream 9 (Ceph 19.2.3)
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taodd/cephtrace/main/files/centos-stream/radostrace/rados-2:19.2.3-0.el9_dwarf.json

# Find the process ID of the ceph client process on the host
# Note: Use the actual ceph client process ID, not the container process ID
ps aux | grep <client process name>

# Trace the process with -p flag and --skip-version-check
sudo ./radostrace -i rados-2:19.2.3-0.el9_dwarf.json -p <PID> --skip-version-check
```

#### osdtrace for CentOS Stream Containers

```bash
# Download osdtrace binary
wget https://github.com/taodd/cephtrace/releases/latest/download/osdtrace
chmod +x osdtrace

# Download DWARF file for CentOS Stream 9 (Ceph 19.2.3)
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taodd/cephtrace/main/files/centos-stream/osdtrace/osd-2:19.2.3-0.el9_dwarf.json

# Find the ceph-osd process ID on the host
# Note: Use the actual ceph-osd process ID, not the container process ID
ps aux | grep ceph-osd

# Trace the OSD process with -p flag and --skip-version-check
sudo ./osdtrace -i osd-2:19.2.3-0.el9_dwarf.json -p <PID> --skip-version-check -x
```

> üì¶ **CentOS Stream Support:** Currently only version 19.2.3's DWARF JSON file is pre-generated for CentOS Stream. We plan to cover more versions in the future.
> üîß **Other Versions:** If you need to trace a different Ceph version, you can generate your own DWARF JSON file by following the [Dwarf json file](#dwarf-json-file) section on a CentOS Stream machine with the target Ceph package version and debug symbols installed.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** When tracing containerized processes, use the actual ceph/ceph-osd process ID from the host, not the container process ID.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build from Source

For non-Ubuntu systems or if you want to build from source:

### Checkout source code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/taodd/cephtrace
cd cephtrace
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Build Prerequisites
On a Debian or Ubuntu based system, use the following apt command to start the build dependencies. If using a system with a different package manager, a different set of commands will be required:
```
sudo apt-get install g++ clang libelf-dev libc6-dev-i386 libdw-dev
```

## Build cephtrace
Build the binaries:
```
cd cephtrace
make
```
It is possible to build the binaries on a different machine and then transfer them to the target host and run.

## Install debug symbols
Debug symbols are required for these tools to work if you don't have a pre-generated dwarf json file for the target version. Each tool needs different debug symbol package. For ubuntu, we now support fetching debug symbols from ```debuginfod``` server automatically.

Please install ```libdebuginfod``` package first:
```
sudo apt-get install libdebuginfod-dev
```
You can also manually install debug packages, please refer (for ubuntu) to [Getting dbgsymddeb Packages](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/debug-symbol-packages#getting-dbgsymddeb-packages).
These are required debug packages for each tool:
- For ```radostrace```:
```sudo apt-get install librbd1-dbgsym librados2-dbgsym```
- For ```osdtrace```:
```sudo apt-get install ceph-osd-dbgsym```

## Dwarf json file
To avoid the need to install debug symbols on every target machine, you can export the DWARF information to a JSON file on a machine with debug symbols installed, then import it on other machines with the same Ceph version.

### Step 1: Export DWARF Information (on a machine with debug symbols)
First, export the DWARF information for your specific Ceph version:

```bash
# Export DWARF info for radostrace
sudo ./radostrace -j radostrace_dwarf.json
```

This will create JSON files containing all the necessary DWARF information with version information embedded.

### Step 2: Import and Use on Target Machines
On any machine with the same Ceph version (but without debug symbols), you can import the JSON file:

```bash
# Use radostrace with imported DWARF data
sudo ./radostrace -i radostrace_dwarf.json
```

### Version Compatibility
The tools automatically check version compatibility when importing JSON files. If the target machine has a different Ceph version than what the JSON file was generated for, the tool will report an error and exit.

### Benefits
- **No debug symbols required** on target machines
- **Faster startup** (no DWARF parsing needed)
- **Consistent results** across machines with the same Ceph version
- **Easy deployment** in production environments

### Pre-generated JSON Files
We provide pre-generated JSON files for common Ceph versions in the `files/ubuntu/radostrace`, `files/ubuntu/osdtrace`, `files/centos-stream/radostrace`, and `files/centos-stream/osdtrace` directories. These files are named with their corresponding version (e.g., `17.2.6-0ubuntu0.22.04.2_dwarf.json` for Ubuntu, `rados-2:19.2.3-0.el9_dwarf.json` for CentOS Stream).

## osdtrace output
Below is an example tracing output from an OSD node:
```
osd 1 pg 20.138 op_r size 8192 client 169954691 tid 150680 throttle_lat 2 recv_lat 11 dispatch_lat 12 queue_lat 41 osd_lat 35 bluestore_lat 231 op_lat 332

```

Each row represents one operation traced on the OSD, with detailed latency breakdown across different stages:

### Operation Types
- ```op_r```: **Read operation** from client to primary OSD
- ```op_w```: **Write operation** from client to primary OSD
- ```subop_w```: **Sub-write operation** from primary OSD to secondary OSDs (replication)

### Latency Stages (using op_w as example)
Taking the write operation: `osd 38 pg 20.16b op_w size 12288 client 179589331 tid 24057 throttle_lat 2 recv_lat 26 dispatch_lat 15 queue_lat 57 osd_lat 187 peers [(34, 8079), (40, 5065)] bluestore_lat 10639 (prepare 107 aio_wait 0 (aio_size 0) seq_wait 6 kv_commit 10525) op_lat 10966`

#### Messenger Level (Network/Message Processing):
- ```throttle_lat 2```: Flow control throttling time (2Œºs) - prevents message overload
- ```recv_lat 26```: Message receive time (26Œºs) from first to last byte - network processing
- ```dispatch_lat 15```: Message dispatch time (15Œºs) - internal dispatch from messenger to OSD Processing level

#### OSD Processing Level:
- ```queue_lat 57```: Time waiting in osd op shard queue (57Œºs) - queuing delay before handling
- ```osd_lat 187```: OSD layer processing time (187Œºs) - client request verification and replication coordination
- ```peers [(34, 8079), (40, 5065)]```: Time spent on waiting from secondary OSDs 34 and 40

#### Storage Backend Level (BlueStore):
- ```bluestore_lat 10639```: Total BlueStore processing time (10639Œºs)
  - ```prepare 107```: Transaction preparation (107Œºs)
  - ```aio_wait 0```: Async I/O wait time (0Œºs)
  - ```seq_wait 6```: Sequencer wait time (6Œºs)
  - ```kv_commit 10525```: Key-value store commit (10525Œºs) - data and metadata persistence

#### Total:
- ```op_lat 10966```: **End-to-end operation latency** (10966Œºs)

All latencies are measured in **microseconds (Œºs)**.

## kfstrace output

**kfstrace** has two modes with different output formats: OSD mode (for data operations) and MDS mode (for metadata operations).

### OSD Mode Output
Below is an example tracing output from a CephFS client performing data operations:
```
TIME     PID      COMMAND      CLIENT_ID  TID              POOL     PG       OP     ACTING_SET           OBJECT                           ATTEMPTS OPS                            LATENCY(us)

- ```OBJECT```: Object name
- ```ATTEMPTS```: Number of send attempts for this operation
- ```OPS```: Detailed OSD operations with offset/length for extent operations
  - Format: ```[op1(offset,length),op2,...]```
  - Examples: ```[read(0,4096)]```, ```[write(4096,8192)]```, ```[call(rbd.parent_get)]```
- ```LATENCY(us)```: End-to-end operation latency in microseconds

### MDS Mode Output
Below is an example tracing output from a CephFS client performing metadata operations:
```
TIME     PID      COMMAND      CLIENT_ID  TID              MDS OP       FILE                             ATTEMPTS UNSAFE_LAT SAFE_LAT   RESULT

14:25:11 3456     touch        4324       9876545          0   create   /home/user/newfile.txt           1        512Œºs      1.2ms      OK
14:25:12 7890     vim          4325       9876546          1   setattr  /home/user/document.txt          1        -          345Œºs      OK
```

Each row represents one kernel client metadata operation sent to MDS:

#### Column Descriptions:
- ```TIME```: Timestamp when the operation completed (HH:MM:SS)
- ```PID```: Process ID of the kernel client
- ```COMMAND```: Process command name (truncated to 12 chars)
- ```CLIENT_ID```: Ceph client global ID
- ```TID```: Transaction ID (operation ID)
- ```MDS```: Target MDS rank number
- ```OP```: MDS operation type
  - Common operations: ```lookup```, ```getattr```, ```readdir```, ```open```, ```create```, ```setattr```, ```unlink```, ```rename```
- ```FILE```: Request path (truncated to 32 chars, ending with "..." if too long)
- ```ATTEMPTS```: Number of send attempts for this operation
- ```UNSAFE_LAT```: Time from submission to unsafe reply (fast acknowledgment)
  - Shows "-" for read-only operations that don't have unsafe replies
  - For write operations, indicates when the MDS has received and processed the request
- ```SAFE_LAT```: Time from submission to safe reply (durable acknowledgment)
  - This is the total end-to-end latency
  - For write operations, indicates when changes are persisted to the journal
- ```RESULT```: Operation result
  - ```OK```: Successful completion (return code 0)
  - ```ERR```: Error occurred (non-zero return code)

#### Understanding MDS Two-Phase Replies:
For write operations (create, setattr, unlink, etc.), MDS uses a two-phase reply protocol:
1. **Unsafe Reply**: Fast acknowledgment that the MDS has received and processed the request
2. **Safe Reply**: Confirmation that changes are durably committed to the journal

Read-only operations (lookup, getattr, readdir) only have safe replies, so ```UNSAFE_LAT``` shows "-".

All latencies are measured in **microseconds (Œºs)** or **milliseconds (ms)** depending on magnitude.

## Kernel Requirements
- The minimum kernel version required is v5.8
