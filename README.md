# Cephtrace 
```cephtrace``` is a project that delivers various ```eBPF``` based ceph tracing tools. These tools can be used to trace different ceph components dynamically, without the need to restart or reconfigure any of the ceph related services. Currently ```radostrace``` and ```osdtrace``` have been implemented.

These tools can provide a great insight on the per-io based performance, and help to quickly identify any potential performance bottlenecks.

## Checkout source code
To start:
```
git clone https://github.com/taodd/cephtrace
cd cephtrace
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Build Prerequisites
On a Debian or Ubuntu based system, use the following apt command to start the build dependencies. If using a system with a different package manager, a different set of commands will be required:
```
sudo apt-get install g++ clang libelf-dev libc6-dev-i386 libdw-dev
```

## Build cephtrace
Build the binaries:
```
cd cephtrace
make
```
It is possible to build the binaries on a different machine and then transfer them to the target host, as long as they are running the same versions of underlying packages as the builder machine.

## Install debug symbols
Debug symbols are required for these tools to work. Each tool needs a different debug symbol package. For ubuntu, we now support fetching debug symbols from ```debuginfod``` server automatically.

Please install ```libdebuginfod``` package first:
```
sudo apt-get install libdebuginfod-dev
```
You can also manually install debug packages in case debuginfod isn't working, please refer to [Getting dbgsymddeb Packages](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/debug-symbol-packages#getting-dbgsymddeb-packages).
These are required debug packages for each tool:
- For ```radostrace```:
```sudo apt-get install librbd1-dbgsym librados2-dbgsym```
- For ```osdtrace```:
```sudo apt-get install ceph-osd-dbgsym```

## Run radostrace
```radostrace``` can trace any librados based ceph client, including vm with rbd volume attached, rgw, cinder, glance...
below is an example for tracing a vm which is doing 4k random read on a rbd volume.
```
:~$ sudo ./radostrace
```

Each row represent one IO sent from the client to the ceph cluster, below is the explanation for each column:
- ```pid```:    ceph client process id
- ```client```: ceph client global id, a unique number to identify the client
- ```tid```:    operation id
- ```pool```:   pool id the operation is sent to
- ```pg```:     pg id the operation is sent to, pool.pg is the pgid we usually refer to
- ```acting```: the OSD acting set this operation is sent to
- ```w/r```:    whether this operation is write or read
- ```size```:   the write/read size of this operation
- ```latency```: the latency of this request in microsecond
- ```object[ops][offset,length]```: the object name, detailed osd op name, op's offset and length

## Run osdtrace
```
:~$ sudo ./osdtrace -x
```

## Notes
- These have been tested on Ubuntu distribution with 5.15 and 6.8 kernels. Other platforms have not been tested.
- It has not yet been tested with containerized processes.
